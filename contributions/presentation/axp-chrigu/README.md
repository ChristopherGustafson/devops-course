## Proposal

We would like to hold a presentation about [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/). Tabnine is a code completion tool that uses AI to give accurate predictions about what code the user wants to type. That way Tabnine can save time by speeding up the process of manually typing code as well as having to look up different code constructions. 

The specific topics we would like to cover are:
* What is code completion?
* How the Tabnine tool uses AI to make code predictions
* How you can use the Tabnine tool 
* How Tabnine can improve your workflow
